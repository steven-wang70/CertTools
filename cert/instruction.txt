For Linux:
1. sudo apt install perl gcc make g++
2. Download the source code openssl-1.0.2e, build it.

For Windows:
1. Download the release packages of openssl-1.0.2e which includes both executable, headers and libraries;
2. The source code contains workaround for output since we could not build the binary of openssl byourselves.
